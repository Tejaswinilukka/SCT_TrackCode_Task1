pandas → handles tabular data (like Excel sheets).

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split → splits your data for training and testing.

sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression → creates the model.

sklearn.metrics → helps measure how good the model is.

numpy → for numerical operations, especially for handling missing values.



To implement a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

square_footage: Total area of the house in square feet.

bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.

bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house.

 ->Target Variable:
price: Market price of the house (in currency, e.g., ₹ or $).
